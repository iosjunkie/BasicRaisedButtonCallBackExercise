# flutter_assignment from Udemy

Just a very basic raised button exercise to change text. Also familiarizing myself again with the use of callback

## Desktop

This is also the first time I've tried to run a desktop flutter app only because it's tedious to run an emulator for this very basic exercise.
- I installed visual studio to make it work
- flutter channel dev
- flutter config --enable-windows-desktop
- flutter run -d windows
